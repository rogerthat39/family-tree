# Family tree site
This project uses Svelte and Sapper to create a basic family tree site. The information is stored in an SQLite database.

## How to run
1. Download the website either by forking the repository or downloading the zip file
2. Install dependencies using ```npm install```. You will need node installed on your computer.
3. Run the project using ```npm run dev```
4. The site should be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## User passwords
Currently there is one user account in the database:
```
username: newuser
password: password
```

Feel free to create, edit and delete people in the family tree within this user account (or create your own account).
